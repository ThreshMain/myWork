    <h2><a name="what">WHAT is Debian?</a></h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="../">Debian Project</a> is an association of individuals who
      have made common cause to create a <a href="free">free</a>
      operating system. This operating system that we have created is called
      <strong>Debian</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make
      your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The
      kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the
      basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Debian systems currently use the
      <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a> kernel or the
      <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>
      kernel. Linux is a piece of software started by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>
      and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. FreeBSD is an
      operating system including a kernel and other software.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels,
      primarily for
      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">the Hurd</a>. The
      Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as
      Mach) to implement different features. The Hurd is free software produced
      by the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come
      from the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>; hence the names:
      GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to
      help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running
      a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with
      over 59000 <a href="../distrib/packages">packages</a> (precompiled
      software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your
      machine), a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it
      possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as
      easily as installing a single application. All of it
      <a href="free">free</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all
      the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At
      the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting
      everything so it all works together.
